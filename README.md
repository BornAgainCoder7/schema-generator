Bread of Life Schema JSON-LD Generator

A lightweight tool for generating structured data that Google actually understands, all without touching a framework.

Built with pure vanilla JavaScript, modern CSS, and the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead (Romans 8:11).

Crafted sometime before sunrise, with a candle lit in front of my cross.
Soli Deo Gloria.
